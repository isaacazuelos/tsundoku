# Known Issues

## Known Bug

- [] `doku: /Users/iaz/.tsundoku.json: openBinaryFile: does not exist` is
  a terrible error message. All IO errors are uncaught like this.

## A Note on Github

I'm not using Github issues due to the size and scope of the project â€” I'd
spend more time writing issues than fixing them if I did.
