# Tsundoku

Track your piles of unread books.

The plans are sketched out in the manual.

## What it will do

The goal is to write a tool to replace the text files that currently track
which books I intend to read and which books I have finished.

### What it won't do

It won't let you read the books, or automatically fetch metadata, or
manipulate the book files at all.

## Requirements and Installation
